## Requirements

You need Node.js 6.3.1 or newer to start developing.

To bootstrap your environment run `npm run bootstrap` in the root
directory of the project.
 
> This npm script will install all dependencies and type definitions

## Development

Run `npm run develop` to start the development server and navigate to
`http://localhost:3000` (as seen in the console output).

Any change you make in the `src/` directory will trigger the browser
to reload. The server is available externally to so you can access
the application on your phone easily.
